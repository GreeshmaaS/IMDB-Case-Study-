# IMDB-Case-Study 
Mini Project for Data Analytics Internship </br></br>
We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online.
In this project, we find some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016, using Python.
